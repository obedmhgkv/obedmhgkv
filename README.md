### Hi there 👋

My name is Obed Murillo, and I am deeply passionate about software development. Over the past 17 years, I have dedicated myself to the craft, finding immense joy in every aspect of the development process, from discovery to going live.

Throughout my career, I have become an expert in eCommerce implementations. I have had the privilege of working across various industries, successfully executing both B2C and B2B implementations from the ground up. Additionally, I have been involved in seamless migrations and the integration of new features into existing implementations. These experiences have allowed me to work with a diverse range of systems, including payment gateways and single sign-on providers.

By combining my extensive knowledge with a strong commitment to delivering high-quality results, I consistently strive to exceed expectations and drive success in each project I undertake.
